            <p class="intro-parag">In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end
              user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="intro-parag">Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers or development team members. User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking
              and communication, that is, they help software teams organize their understanding of the system and its context.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="intro-parag">User stories are often confused with system requirements. A requirement is a formal description of need; a user story is an informal description of a feature.</p>

              <p class="history-parag">In 1998 Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."
                With Extreme Programming (XP), user stories were a part of the planning game.
                In 2001, Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:</p>

              <p class="history-parag"> User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for
                formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.</p>

            <p class="usage-parag">As a central part of many agile development methodologies, such as in XP's planning game, user stories define what has to be built in the software project. User stories are prioritized by the customer (or the
              product
              owner in Scrum) to indicate which are most important for the system and will be broken down into tasks and estimated by the developers. One way of estimating is via a Fibonacci scale.</p>

          <div class="main-articles">
            <p class="relation-parag">In many contexts user stories are used and also summarized in groups for semantic and organizational reasons. The different usages depend on the point-of-view, e.g. either looking from a user perspective as
              product owner in relation to features or a company perspective in relation to task organization.</p>
            </br>
          </div>

          <div class="main-articles">
            <p class="relation-parag">While some suggest to use 'epic' and 'theme' as labels for any thinkable kind of grouping of user stories, organization management tends to use it for strong structuring and uniting work loads. For instance,
              Jira,
              seems to use a hierarchically organized to-do-list, in which they named the first level of to-do-tasks 'user-story', the second level 'epics' ( grouping of user stories ) and the third level 'initiatives' ( grouping of epics ).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="main-articles">
            <p class="relation-parag">However, initiatives are not always present in product management development and just add another level of granularity. In Jira, 'themes' exist ( for tracking purposes ) that allow to cross-relate and group
              items
              of different parts of the fixed hierarchy. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="main-articles">
            <p class="relation-parag"> In this usage, Jira, shifts the meaning of themes in an organization perspective: e.g how much time did we spent on developing theme "xyz". But another definition of themes is: a set of big group of stories,
              epics, features etc for a user that forms a common semantic unit or goal. There is probably not a common definition because different approaches exist for different styles of product design and development. In these sense, some also
              suggest to not use any kind of hard groups and hierarchies. </p>

                user
                stories), 'themes' (collections of related user stories) or 'activities'. These are identified by orienting at the user’s workflow or "the order you'd explain the behavior of the system". Vertically, below the epics, the actual story
                cards are allocated and ordered by priority. The first horizontal row is a "walking skeleton" and below that represents increasing sophistication. </p>
